/**
 * A directive to translate content according to the current language.
 *
 * Use this directive instead of the component if you need to translate HTML content.
 * It's too tricky to support HTML content within the component because we cannot get the raw HTML to use as `msgid`.
 *
 * This directive has a similar interface to the <translate> component, supporting
 * `translate-comment`, `translate-context`, `translate-plural`, `translate-n`.
 *
 * `<p v-translate translate-comment='Good stuff'>This is <strong class='txt-primary'>Sparta</strong>!</p>`
 *
 * If you need interpolation, you must add an expression that outputs binding value that changes with each of the
 * context variable:
 * `<p v-translate="fullName + location">I am %{ fullName } and from %{ location }</p>`
